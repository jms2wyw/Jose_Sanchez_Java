This file that I included is a single file amongst many others that make up a program named GameStore. This program is designed to make a RESTful api for a game store 
that stores all the information of games available in that store using Spring Boot. 

This file of code is the service layer which sets the application boundary and its set of available operations. This file has the operations that can make the program
works. Using the CRUD method You are able to make, save, update and delete a game. There is also other operations I added to find games by a special category.

Operations CRUD:
Create Game
Read and Save Game
Update Game
Delete Game

Other Operations:
Find games by esrb rating
Find Game by Title
